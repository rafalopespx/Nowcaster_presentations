# Basic reproduction number (R0)

+ $R_0$ is the basic number (ratio) of reproduction and it characterizes the transmission potential of a disease

--

+ It represents __expected__ number of secondary cases produced by a typical primary case in an entirely __susceptible__ population

--

+ The $R_0$ of a disease is function of human __social behavior__ and organization, as well as the innate __biological__ characteristics of particular pathogens:
 - __Transmissibility__
 - __Contact rate__
 - __Infectious period__

--

+ Constant review
  - Measles: estimate: 12-18
  - Systematic review by Guerra et al (2017):  3-200 (!!)

---

## Instantaneous (effective) reproduction number (Rt, Reff)

<br />
$R_t$ is the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case and it is usually a fraction of the $R_0$: 

--

.center[

  $$R_t = R_0 X$$
]

--

where, in a simple model, $X$ is the frequency of __susceptible__ individuals in a population at a given time t
 
---

## Why calculate Reff?

<br />
It is commonly used to characterize pathogen __transmissibility__ during an epidemic. <br />

--
<br />
The monitoring of R over time provides feedback on the __effectiveness__ of interventions and on the need to intensify control efforts.
<br />
--
<br />
To control an epidemic, R needs to be __persistently__ reduced to a level below 1.
<br />
---

## (effective) reproduction number (Rt, Reff)

<br />
Important values of $R_{eff}$:
<br />

.center[

 $R_{eff} > 1$:  number of new cases __increases__ <br />
 $R_{eff} = 1$:  equilibrium of number of cases (__endemic__) <br />
 $R_{eff} < 1$ : number of new cases __decreases__ <br />
]


--

<br />
__Reff (and R0) is not a rate!
  It is a number, a ratio.__
<br />
--
<br />
Estimate the Reff for a local community, where contacts/transmissions occur

---

## How to estimate the Reff?

Ratio between the incidence number of new cases at a time t and the incidence number of new cases  at time t-1:

```{r tabela, out.width = 800, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/tabela_reff.png")
```

However we must consider that the expected number of incidence cases at a given time __t__ depends on the number of incidence cases in previous time steps __t-s__ weighted an infectivity function __ws__

$$E[I_t] = R_t\sum_{s=1}^{t}I_{t-s}w_s$$

---

## Database and dates

There are 3 important dates for a given case: 

```{r timeline, out.width = 800, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/timeline.png")
```

Brazilian national health surveillance of hospitalized individuals (SIVEP-Gripe) we have
access to at least 2 of them:
  - Date of onset of first symptons
  - Reporting date
  
---

## Correcting delays

How to correct each part of the timeline events on notification system:

```{r timeline2, out.width=800, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/timeline2.png")
```

---

## Correcting delays

In our [site](https://covid19br.github.io), we go until 1st symptons date corrections:

```{r timelineobs, out.width=800, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/timelineobs.png")
```

---

## Methods to estimate $R_{eff}$

There are several methods to calculate $R_{eff}$, the most known are:

- Robert Koch Institute 2020

- Wallinga & Teunis 2004

- Bettencourt & Ribeiro 2008

- Cori et al 2013

--
  + Time series of cases
  + Serial interval distribution (transmission tree) - Incorporates uncertainty in the distrbitution the time between onset of symptons in a primary case and the onset of symptons in a secondary case.
  
---

## Reff Observatório

We calculate the $R_{eff}$ by Cori et al, incorporating the nowcasting in the workflow:

```{r timelineobs2, out.width=800, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/timelineobs.png")
```

---

## Nowcasting

Nowcasting estimates the number of cases that have already occurred (that already
have a 1st day of symptoms) but not yet been reported in the database, a forecasting for now:

```{r nowcasting, out.width=600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/nowcasting.png")
```

---

## Nowcasting

```
]

.pull-right[
 
+ Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing (McGough et al. 2020)
 
+ Posteriors series
 
]

---

## Back-projection

Back-projection estimates the number of cases by infection date, therefore including the incubation period (SARS-CoV2 ~ 5 days)

```{r backproj, out.width=600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/backprojection.png")
```

---

## Back-projection

Back-projection estimates the number of cases by infection date, therefore including the incubation period (SARS-CoV2 ~ 5 days)

.pull-left[
```{r backproj2, out.width=600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/backprojection.png")
```
]

.pull-right[

+ Expectation-Maximization Smoothing (Becker et al 1991)

+ Bootstrap Simulation 

```{r serial, out.width=400, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/serial2.png")
```

]

---

## Credible intervals of the Reff

+ Nowcasting CI: delays from de reporting system

+ Backprojetion CI: delay from the incubation period.

+ Transmission tree CI: from the method proposed by Cori et al 2013 based on cases
that will come from the transmission tree

---

## Different delay corrections

```{r decisiontree, out.width=800, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/decisiontree.png")
```

---

## Results

+ SIVEP-Gripe (hospitalized cases)

+ Positive cases diagnosed by RT-PCR

+ Base from May 18,2020 (with a consolidated base of June 30,2020)

+ State capitals:
  São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Manaus (AM), Fortaleza (CE)

---

## Discussion

+ Estimate the Rt based on the __notification date is not accurate__

+ Important delays that can be corrected: reporting system and incubation period

+ Backprojection can affect the end of the Rt time series, decreasing the Rt values due to
the lack of data feeding the end of the time series

+ The nowcasting increases the CI of the Rt

---

## Discussion

+ Decisions made by policy makers and health authorities __must consider the CI__ and not
only the mean value. The entire range of the CI must be lower than 1 to be considered
controlled.

+ When using the back-projection correction, one should avoid using the most recent
estimates of Rt (final temporal series).

+ Other metrics should also be taken into account for public health decisions.
values of Rt around 1 associated with a high number of new cases per day can easily fuel a new rise

+ Incidence will change on different time of a pandemic, now we have __vaccines__ which reduces symptomatic. This have to be taken into account.

+ We use a sliding window of 6 days

+ Serial interval by Nishiura et al 2020 for MCMC estimation for the
transmission tree

## Nowcasting

+ We use a modified function from the NobBs R package (McGough et
al 2020)

+ Trim of 5 days in the time series end

+ Time window of delay:
São Paulo (SP): 70 days
Manaus (AM): 60 days.
Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Fortaleza (CE) no window.

---

## Back-projection

+ The incidence data is corrected by discounting delays from infection
to the first day of symptoms using an incubation distribution defined
by a lognormal (mean=5.2 days and 95% CI = [4.1, 7.0] days (He et al
2020).

+ In contrast to the nowcasting method, which includes cases
considering the delay of the notification system, the
back-projection method just estimate the shift in the time series
backwards with no addition of cases

---

## Back-projection

+ The Expectation-Maximization-Smoothing procedure of Becker et al (1991}
gives a sample estimation of the mean number of individuals infected at
time t and is denoted by $\lambda t$.

+ The sample estimation must be accompanied by a confidence interval
which can be estimated by a bootstrap method (see Yip 2008).

+ We choose to return a sample draw from a Poisson distribution with mean
$\lambda t$ after we have back-projected our data.

---

## Back-projection

+ This procedure is repeated for 1,000 posterior nowcasted series. The
sample error for the $\lambda t$ computation is incorporated when we consider a
large number of back-projected samples of a nowcasted series.

+ The complete routine is implemented in C++ and is already integrated with
R via the Rcpp package
